# Catspotter

**A community web app to help lost cats get home** üêà

Imagine a world where no lost cat goes unnoticed. This is what **catspotter** tries to achieve, with harnessing the power of community and neighborhood to bring lost cats back home.

## About The Project

Created as the final project at the end of the WBS Coding School web- and app developer bootcamp. Solo work, created and designed by yours truly, and expecting upcoming changes, further development and additional functions to be added.

**Future development plan:**

- rewrite the project in Nuxt
- utilize TypeScript
- integrate OAuth for login / register
- real-time notification system with WebSocket
- add new functions to the map (advanced connection with infosheets, POI, etc.)
- get it out in the real world to be able to be used by everybody ‚ù§Ô∏è
- make the app into a PWA

## Demo

The frontend of the project is deployed on Vercel, the backend is deployed on Render.
You can check it out here:
